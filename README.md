# Lab: Programming in AWS

## Student Information

* Name
* Semester/Year
* CRN

## Instructions

In this repo, you will be completing various labs in [Learn Python On AWS Workshop](https://learn-to-code.workshop.aws). These labs are designed to teach basic programming skills and concepts needed to successfully do simple tasks in AWS. It is not designed to teach you how to program applications like games or websites.

This workshop may be used for multiple labs in CIT 175 so pay attention to the assignment for which ones to complete. Also, some labs have multiple steps, unless noted all steps must be completed.

* [Lab 1 - A Simple Function](lab01/README.md)
* [Lab 2 - Introduction to Boto3](lab02/README.md)
* [Lab 3 - The main() function](lab03/README.md)
* [Lab 4 - Arguments](lab04/README.md)
* [Lab 5 - Inputs](lab05/README.md)
* [Lab 6 - Looping over lists and JSON](lab06/README.md)
* [Lab 7 - If Statements](lab07/README.md)
* [Lab 8 - Logging](lab08/README.md)
* [Lab 9 - Try-Except](lab09/README.md)

## Rubric / Grading Criteria

See Canvas for specific points breakdown on this assignment.

Grading is done via a combination of automatic grading in GitHub and manual testing by the instructor. Points may be deducted based on the following criteria:

* Must contain working Python code
* Code follows all instructions listed above
* Code is well structured, formatted, and commented
* Code is able to be manually run without errors
* Code uses concepts as covered in the current topic for the lab
* If unit tests are provided, partial credit will be given for passed tests for 1 or more passed tests
* Points may still be deducted based on the grading criteria above even if the assignment passes the Auto Grading unit tests. Creating code that is well structured, formatted, and commented cannot be tested automatically. So you can pass all your auto grading tests, but still lose points.
